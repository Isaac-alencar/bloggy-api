[![N|Solid](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*Qtaw9MXAkwlHQlzAQYScFA.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

 ####  API builded with NodeJS + Sequelize & Express
 
This API was builded for a microblog. I just use a Simple CRUD, JWT authentication and more.




# Get started 
First thing first, install sequelize
```ssh
$ npm install --save sequelize
``` 
ou 
```ssh
$ yarn add sequelize
```

now, itâ€™s the part that you choose your SQL database, on this project, was chosen
postgres. Postgres is an amazing SQL database as bigger as you'll needed and performatic too. So, let's add:
```ssh 
$ npm install --save pg pg-hstore
``` 
ou 
```ssh
$ yarn add pg pg-hstore 
```


And just init code!!
